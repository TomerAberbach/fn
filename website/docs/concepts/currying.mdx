# Currying

This is an in-depth explanation of currying. For simple usage examples, check
out the ["Getting started" page](/docs/getting-started).

## What is it?

[Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) is the technique of
transforming a regular function into one that can be called with a prefix of its
parameters, in which case the function doesn't return its usual result. Instead
it returns _another_ curried function that accepts the remaining parameters.

For example, consider the following function:

```js
const sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c
```

Without currying, the only way to call it would be with three arguments, like
`sum(1, 2, 3)`, but with currying it could be called in any of the following
ways:

```js
sum(1, 2, 3)
sum(1, 2)(3)
sum(1)(2, 3)
sum(1)(2)(3)
```

## How is it used in `lfi`?

`lfi`'s functions are automatically curried where applicable[^1] and their
parameters are perfectly arranged for use in the `pipe` function, which provides
a syntax similar to
[method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) without giving
up
[tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking)[^2].

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import {
  filter,
  flatMap,
  map,
  pipe,
  reduce,
  toGrouped,
  toMap,
  toSet,
} from 'lfi'
import zoo from 'zoo'

const getSlothNamesByAgeWithCurrying = () =>
  pipe(
    zoo.exhibits,
    flatMap(exhibit => exhibit.animals),
    filter(animal => animal.species === `sloth`),
    map(sloth => [sloth.age, sloth.name]),
    reduce(toGrouped(toSet(), toMap())),
  )
console.log(getSlothNamesByAgeWithCurrying())

const getSlothNamesByAgeWithoutCurrying = () =>
  reduce(
    toGrouped(toSet(), toMap()),
    map(
      sloth => [sloth.age, sloth.name],
      filter(
        animal => animal.species === `sloth`,
        flatMap(exhibit => exhibit.animals, zoo.exhibits),
      ),
    ),
  )
console.log(getSlothNamesByAgeWithoutCurrying())
```

`getSlothNamesByAgeWithCurrying` is easier to read because the operation order
matches the reading order. It works because:

1. Each function call returns a function that accepts an iterable.

   For example, `filter` accepts two parameters: a predicate function and an
   iterable, but in ``filter(animal => animal.species === `sloth`)`` it's called
   with one argument. Thus, the expression evaluates to a function that accepts
   only the second parameter, an iterable.

2. `pipe` passes its first argument, an iterable, through each function argument
   in order, and then returns the last operation's result.

The result? Readable code that tree shakes perfectly. The functions imported in
the code above bundle to just
[790 B gzipped](https://bundlejs.com/?text=export%20{%20filter,%20flatMap,%20map,%20pipe,%20reduce,%20toGrouped,%20toMap,%20toSet%20}%20from%20%27lfi%27&bundle)!

[^1]:
    `lfi` has many zero or one parameter functions, which are pointless to
    curry, and a few [variadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function)
    functions, which are impossible to curry.

[^2]:
    Tree shaking class and object literal methods is
    [really hard](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/349).
