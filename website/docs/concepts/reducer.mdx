# Reducer

This is an in-depth explanation of reducers. For simple usage examples, check
out the ["Getting started" page](/docs/getting-started).

## What is it?

A reducer defines how to combine a lazy collection of values into a single final
value, synchronously or asynchronously. As the values are iteratively combined,
the in-progress final value is known as the "accumulator".

A reducer is primarily represented by the `OptionalReducer`,
`AsyncOptionalReducer`, `Reducer`, `AsyncReducer`, `KeyedReducer`, and
`AsyncKeyedReducer` types, depending on the async work required, the possibility
of not producing a final value, and the need to access accumulator values by
key.

There are also other types that represent reducers, such as `FunctionReducer`
and `AsyncFunctionReducer`, but they all normalize to one of the aforementioned
types using `normalizeReducer`.

:::tip

`lfi` functions with names that start with `to`, like `toArray` and `toSum`, are
reducers.

:::

## How do I use it?

A sync reducer can be passed to the `reduce`, `reduceAsync`, and `reduceConcur`
functions while an async reducer can be passed to the `reduceAsync` and
`reduceConcur` functions.

Reducers can also be composed together to create more complex and powerful ones
using higher-order reducers such `toGrouped` and `toMultiple`.

### `FunctionReducer` and `AsyncFunctionReducer`

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString>
<TabItem value='sync' label='Sync'>

The simplest reducer is the function reducer. It defines how to combine two
values of the same type into a single value, also of that type.

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { map, or, pipe, reduce } from 'lfi'

const sumSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    numbers,
    map(number => number * number),
    // Reduce the iterable to one value by repeatedly calling the function with
    // pairs of values until only one remains
    reduce((number1, number2) => {
      console.log(`add(${number1}, ${number2})`)
      return number1 + number2
    }),
    // But what if the iterable is empty? `reduce` returns an optional when
    // passed a function reducer because it doesn't define what to do for zero
    // values
    or(() => 0),
  )

console.log(sumSquares([1, 2, 3]))
//=> 14
console.log(sumSquares([]))
//=> 0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='async' label='Async'>

The simplest async reducer is the async function reducer. It defines how to
asynchronously combine two values of the same type into a single value, also of
that type.

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { asAsync, mapAsync, orAsync, pipe, reduceAsync } from 'lfi'

const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

const sumSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    // This is an async iterable, but async reducers also work with concur iterables
    asAsync(numbers),
    mapAsync(number => number * number),
    // Reduce the async iterable to one value by repeatedly calling the function
    // with pairs of values until only one remains
    reduceAsync(async (number1, number2) => {
      console.log(`add(${number1}, ${number2})`)
      // Async work is allowed in async reducers
      await delay(100)
      return number1 + number2
    }),
    // But what if the async iterable is empty? `reduceAsync` returns an async
    // optional when passed an async function reducer because it doesn't define
    // what to do for zero values
    orAsync(() => 0),
  )

console.log(await sumSquares([1, 2, 3]))
//=> 14
console.log(await sumSquares([]))
//=> 0
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `OptionalReducer` and `AsyncOptionalReducer`

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString>
<TabItem value='sync' label='Sync'>

A slightly more complex reducer is the optional reducer. It's an object with:

- An `add` function, matching the behavior of a function reducer[^1]
- An optional `finish` function, which transforms the final value

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { map, or, pipe, reduce } from 'lfi'

const sumSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    numbers,
    map(number => number * number),
    // This behaves identically to passing a function reducer
    reduce({
      add: (number1, number2) => {
        console.log(`add(${number1}, ${number2})`)
        return number1 + number2
      },
    }),
    or(() => 0),
  )

console.log(sumSquares([1, 2, 3]))
//=> 14
console.log(sumSquares([]))
//=> 0

const sumSquaresMessage = numbers =>
  pipe(
    numbers,
    map(number => number * number),
    // This behaves identically to passing a function reducer, except the final
    // value is transformed using `finish`
    reduce({
      add: (number1, number2) => {
        console.log(`add(${number1}, ${number2})`)
        return number1 + number2
      },
      finish: sum => {
        console.log(`finish(${sum})`)
        return `The sum of the squares is ${sum}`
      },
    }),
    or(() => `There were no numbers!`),
  )

console.log(sumSquaresMessage([1, 2, 3]))
//=> The sum of the squares is 14
console.log(sumSquaresMessage([]))
//=> There were no numbers!
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='async' label='Async'>

A slightly more complex async reducer is the async optional reducer. It's an
object with:

- An `add` function, matching the behavior of an async function reducer[^1]
- An optional `finish` function, which asynchronously transforms the final value

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { asAsync, mapAsync, orAsync, pipe, reduceAsync } from 'lfi'

const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

const sumSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    // This is an async iterable, but async reducers also work with concur iterables
    asAsync(numbers),
    mapAsync(number => number * number),
    // This behaves identically to passing an async function reducer
    reduceAsync({
      add: async (number1, number2) => {
        console.log(`add(${number1}, ${number2})`)
        await delay(100)
        return number1 + number2
      },
    }),
    orAsync(() => 0),
  )

console.log(await sumSquares([1, 2, 3]))
//=> 14
console.log(await sumSquares([]))
//=> 0

const sumSquaresMessage = numbers =>
  pipe(
    // This is an async iterable, but async reducers also work with concur iterables
    asAsync(numbers),
    mapAsync(number => number * number),
    // This behaves identically to passing an async function reducer, except the
    // final value is transformed using `finish`
    reduceAsync({
      add: async (number1, number2) => {
        console.log(`add(${number1}, ${number2})`)
        await delay(100)
        return number1 + number2
      },
      finish: async sum => {
        console.log(`finish(${sum})`)
        await delay(1000)
        return `The sum of the squares is ${sum}`
      },
    }),
    orAsync(() => `There were no numbers!`),
  )

console.log(await sumSquaresMessage([1, 2, 3]))
//=> The sum of the squares is 14
console.log(await sumSquaresMessage([]))
//=> There were no numbers!
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `Reducer` and `AsyncReducer`

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString>
<TabItem value='sync' label='Sync'>

An even more complex reducer is _the_ reducer. It's an object with:

- A `create` function, which produces the initial accumulator value
- An `add` function, which produces a new accumulator by combining the current
  accumulator with a value from the iterable
- An optional `finish` function, which transforms the final value

Unlike an optional reducer, the accumulator's type can differ from the type of
the values in the iterable.

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { map, or, pipe, reduce } from 'lfi'

const sumSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    numbers,
    map(number => number * number),
    // Reduce the iterable to one value by calling `create`, and then calling
    // `add` with the current accumulator and the next iterable value to get the
    // new accumulator until the iterable is exhausted
    reduce(
      // This is exactly how `lfi`'s `toSum` function is implemented!
      {
        create: () => {
          console.log(`create()`)
          return 0
        },
        add: (sum, number) => {
          console.log(`add(${sum}, ${number})`)
          return sum + number
        },
      },
    ),
    // No `or` needed here! `reduce` doesn't return an optional for a full
    // reducer because it defines what to do for zero values using `create`
  )

console.log(sumSquares([1, 2, 3]))
//=> 14
console.log(sumSquares([]))
//=> 0

const meanSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    numbers,
    map(number => number * number),
    // The accumulator's type can differ from the type of the values in the
    // iterable. This is useful for maintaining multiple pieces of state while
    // reducing and then aggregating the final state in `finish`
    reduce(
      // This _isn't_ how `lfi`'s `toMean` function is implemented. Read on to
      // learn more!
      {
        create: () => {
          console.log(`create()`)
          return { sum: 0, count: 0 }
        },
        add: ({ sum, count }, number) => {
          console.log(`add({ sum: ${sum}, count: ${count} }, ${number})`)
          return { sum: sum + number, count: count + 1 }
        },
        finish: ({ sum, count }) => {
          console.log(`finish({ sum: ${sum}, count: ${count} })`)
          return count === 0 ? NaN : sum / count
        },
      },
    ),
  )

console.log(meanSquares([1, 2, 3]))
//=> 4.666666666666667
console.log(meanSquares([]))
//=> NaN
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='async' label='Async'>

An even more complex async reducer is _the_ async reducer. It's an object with:

- A `create` function, which asynchronously produces the initial accumulator
  value
- An `add` function, which asynchronously produces a new accumulator by
  combining the current accumulator with a value from the iterable
- An optional `combine` function, which asynchronously produces a new
  accumulator by combining two accumulators
- An optional `finish` function, which asynchronously transforms the final value

Unlike an async optional reducer, the accumulator's type can differ from the
type of the values in the async iterable.

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { asAsync, mapAsync, orAsync, pipe, reduceAsync } from 'lfi'

const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

const sumSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    // This is an async iterable, but async reducers also work with concur iterables
    asAsync(numbers),
    mapAsync(number => number * number),
    // Reduce the async iterable to one value by calling `create`, and then
    // calling `add` with the current accumulator and the next iterable value to
    // get the new accumulator or calling `combine` with two accumulators to get
    // a new accumulator, until the async iterable is exhausted
    reduceAsync({
      create: async () => {
        console.log(`create()`)
        await delay(5)
        return 0
      },
      add: async (sum, number) => {
        console.log(`add(${sum}, ${number})`)
        await delay(100)
        return sum + number
      },
      combine: async (sum1, sum2) => {
        console.log(`combine(${sum1}, ${sum2})`)
        await delay(10)
        return sum1 + sum2
      },
    }),
    // No `or` needed here! `reduceAsync` doesn't return an async optional for a
    // full async reducer because it defines what to do for zero values using `create`
  )

console.log(await sumSquares([1, 2, 3]))
//=> 14
console.log(await sumSquares([]))
//=> 0

const meanSquares = numbers =>
  pipe(
    // This is an async iterable, but async reducers also work with concur iterables
    asAsync(numbers),
    mapAsync(number => number * number),
    // The accumulator's type can differ from the type of the values in the
    // async iterable. This is useful for maintaining multiple pieces of state
    // while reducing and then aggregating the final state in `finish`
    reduceAsync({
      create: async () => {
        console.log(`create()`)
        await delay(5)
        return { sum: 0, count: 0 }

          `combine({`,
          `sum: ${acc1.sum}, count: ${acc1.count} }, {`,
          `sum: ${acc2.sum}, count: ${acc2.count} })`,
        )
        await delay(10)

### `KeyedReducer` and `AsyncKeyedReducer`

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString>
<TabItem value='sync' label='Sync'>

The most complex reducer is the keyed reducer. It is essentially a full reducer
that:

- Only works on iterables containing key-value pairs, arrays containing two
  values
- Has a `get` function, which produces the value in the accumulator associated
  with the given key, or the
  [`NO_ENTRY` sentinel value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value)[^2]
  if the accumulator does not contain the key

The `get` function is currently only called by the higher-order `toGrouped`
reducer.

:::note

It's unlikely you'd need to implement a `KeyedReducer` unless you're
implementing a reducer for your own custom keyed collection type.

:::

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { pipe, reduce, toArray, toGrouped, NO_ENTRY } from 'lfi'

/** A map that always has a sloth! 🦥 */
class SlothMap extends Map {
  get(key) {
    if (!super.has(key) && key === `sloth`) {
      // Throw to avoid admitting there's no sloth.
      throw new Error(`Something went wrong...`)
    }

    return super.get(key)
  }

  has(key) {
    return key === `sloth` || super.has(key)
  }
}

const toSlothMap = () => ({
  create: () => {
    console.log(`create()`)
    return new SlothMap()
  },
  add: (acc, [key, value]) => {
    console.log(
      `add(${acc}, [${JSON.stringify(key)}, ${JSON.stringify(value)}])`,
    )
    return acc.set(key, value)
  },
  get: (acc, key) => {
    console.log(`get(${acc}, ${JSON.stringify(key)})`)
    return acc.has(key) ? acc.get(key) : NO_ENTRY
  },
})

const slothMap1 = pipe(
  [
    [`dog`, `bark`],
    [`cat`, `meow`],
    [`bunny`, `purr`],
  ],
  // This reduces the pairs to a `SlothMap`, but doesn't make use of the `get` function
  reduce(toSlothMap()),
)

console.log(slothMap1.get(`dog`))
//=> bark
console.log(slothMap1.has(`sloth`))
//=> true

const slothMap2 = pipe(
  [
    [`dog`, `bark`],
    [`cat`, `meow`],
    [`dog`, `woof`],
    [`bunny`, `purr`],
    [`cat`, `purr`],
  ],
  // This reduces the pairs to a `SlothMap` that maps each key to an array of the
  // values it was associated with. This _does_ make use of the `get` function
  reduce(toGrouped(toArray(), toSlothMap())),
)

console.log(slothMap2.get(`dog`))
//=> [ 'bark', 'woof' ]
console.log(slothMap2.has(`sloth`))
//=> true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='async' label='Async'>

The most complex async reducer is the async keyed reducer. It is essentially a
full async reducer that:

- Only works on iterables containing key-value pairs, arrays containing two
  values
- Has a `get` function, which asynchronously produces the value in the
  accumulator associated with the given key, or the
  [`NO_ENTRY` sentinel value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value)[^2]
  if the accumulator does not contain the key

The `get` function is currently only called by the higher-order `toGrouped`
reducer.

:::note

It's unlikely you'd need to implement an `AsyncKeyedReducer` unless you're
implementing an async reducer for your own custom async keyed collection type.

### Composing

Probably the most powerful aspect of reducers is that they can be composed
together to create more complex ones using higher-order reducers.

#### `toGrouped`

`toGrouped` accepts an "inner" reducer and an "outer" keyed reducer to create a
reducer that:

1. Accepts an iterable of key-value pairs
2. Groups values by key using the outer reducer
3. Reduces each group using the inner reducer

Plus, `toGrouped` does not unnecessarily buffer each group's values. It streams
each group through the inner reducer!

For example, consider the following code:

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString>
<TabItem value='sync' label='Sync'>

```js playground

#### `mapReducer` and `mapAsyncReducer`

`mapReducer` and `mapAsyncReducer` are to reducers what `map`, `mapAsync`, and
`mapConcur` are to iterables. `mapReducer` and `mapAsyncReducer` accept a
callback and a reducer to create a reducer identical to the input one, except
it's final value is transformed using the callback.

For example, consider the following code:

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString>
<TabItem value='sync' label='Sync'>

```js playground
import { mapReducer, pipe, reduce, toCount, toMultiple, toSum } from 'lfi'

const computeMean = numbers =>
  pipe(
    numbers,
    reduce(
      // This is exactly how `lfi`'s `toMean` function is implemented!
      mapReducer(
        ([sum, count]) => (count === 0 ? NaN : sum / count),
        toMultiple([toSum(), toCount()]),
      ),
    ),
  )

console.log(computeMean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
//=> 3

console.log(computeMean([]))
//=> NaN
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='async' label='Async'>

```js playground
import {
  asAsync,
  mapAsyncReducer,
  pipe,
  reduceAsync,
  toCount,
  toMultiple,
  toSum,
} from 'lfi'

const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

const computeMean = numbers =>
  pipe(
    asAsync(numbers),
    reduceAsync(
      mapAsyncReducer(
        async ([sum, count]) => {
          // Async work is allowed in async reducers
          await delay(100)
          return count === 0 ? NaN : sum / count
        },
        toMultiple([toSum(), toCount()]),
      ),
    ),
  )

console.log(await computeMean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
//=> 3

console.log(await computeMean([]))
//=> NaN
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## In what order are values combined?

When passing a sync reducer, `reduce`, `reduceAsync`, and `reduceConcur` combine
values in iteration order. For example, consider the following code:

<Tabs groupId='protocol' queryString>
<TabItem value='sync' label='Sync'>

```js
// Assume this gets the next value in the iterable
const next = () => {
  /* ... */
}

// The first value in the iterable becomes the accumulator
let acc = next()
// Each subsequent value in the iterable combines with the current accumulator
// to become the new accumulator
acc = add(acc, next())
acc = add(acc, next())
// ...
// Then the accumulator goes through a final transformation, if applicable
acc = finish(acc)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='async' label='Async'>

```js
// Assume this gets the next value in the async iterable
const next = async () => {
  /* ... */
}

// The first value in the async iterable becomes the accumulator
let acc = await next()
// Each subsequent value in the async iterable combines with the current
// accumulator to become the new accumulator
acc = add(acc, await next())
acc = add(acc, await next())
// ...
// Then the accumulator goes through a final transformation, if applicable
acc = finish(acc)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

However, when passing an async reducer, `reduceAsync` does not necessarily
combine in this same order, even though an async iterable has a clear iteration
order. Why is that?

Consider the following code:

```js
// Assume this gets the next value in the async iterable
const next = async () => {
  /* ... */
}

let acc = await next()
// What if awaiting this `add` call takes a long time? 🤔
acc = await add(acc, await next())
acc = await add(
  acc,
  // We're unnecessarily waiting to kick off this async work!
  await next(),
)
// ...
acc = await finish(acc)
```

Each `await next()` or `await add(...)` may take a long time, and in the
meantime no other async work is being kicked off. It's inefficient to wait on
the first `add(...)` promise to resolve before kicking off another `next()` call
because that's not maximizing the async work happening concurrently.

Instead of alternating between awaiting `next()` and `add(...)` sequentially,
`lfi` maximizes the async work happening concurrently by:

- Iterating through the async iterable as quickly as possible
- Kicking off an `add(...)` call that doesn't block the async iterable iteration
  whenever there's an accumulator and async iterable value available to combine
- Kicking off a `combine(...)` call that doesn't block the async iterable
  iteration whenever there are two accumulators available to combine
- Kicking off an `add(await create(), ...)` call that doesn't block the async
  iterable iteration whenever an async iterable value is available, but there is
  no accumulator to combine it with. This makes progress because an accumulator
  can be combined with an async iterable value or another accumulator, but two
  async iterable values cannot be combined

This continues until one accumulator remains, at which point it is tranformed
with `finish` and returned.

`reduceConcur` works the same way, but the observed behavior is less surprising
because the iteration order of a concur iterable is already not deterministic.

## How is it different from [`Array.prototype.reduce`'s callback function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce#callbackfn)?

A sync function reducer is almost identical to `Array.prototype.reduce`'s
callback function, but reducers in general are more powerful because they can:

- Define additional functions that enable encapsulation, composition, and
  improved performance in the async case
- Be async while `Array.prototype.reduce`'s callback function cannot be without
  making the accumulator a promise

## How is defining `finish` different from transforming _after_ `reduce`, `reduceAsync`, or `reduceConcur`?

In some cases it's not! However, the `finish` function is still useful for:

- Encapsulating reducer logic, which is especially useful when composing
  reducers
- Producing a final value whose type differs from the input types, in the case
  of an `OptionalReducer` or `AsyncOptionalReducer`

[^1]:
    Under the hood, a function reducer is normalized into an optional reducer
    with just an `add` function.

[^2]:
    `NO_ENTRY` is used instead of `null` or `undefined` because the latter may
    be valid key-value pair values.
