# Getting started

## Install

Run the following command to install `lfi` from
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lfi):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>

```sh
npm install lfi
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='yarn' label='Yarn'>

```sh
yarn add lfi
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='pnpm' label='pnpm'>

```sh
pnpm add lfi
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Or import `lfi` directly from a
[CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='html' label='HTML'>

```html
<script type="module">
  import {
    filter,
    map,
    pipe,
    reduce,
    toArray,
  } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/lfi'

  // Your code...
</script>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='deno' label='Deno'>

```js
import { filter, map, pipe, reduce, toArray } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/lfi'

// Your code...
```

</TabItem>

## Examples

### Sync iterables

`lfi` exports functions for processing sync iterables. Here we show how to:

1. Take an iterable, in this case an array
2. Map and filter its elements
3. Collect the elements into a data structure, in this case an array

```js playground
import { filter, map, pipe, reduce, toArray } from 'lfi'

const messySlothDiaryEntries = [
  [`Strawberry`, `slept`],
  [`max`, `ate  `],
  [`max`, ``],
  [`STRAWBERRY`, `climbed`],
  [`Bitsy`, `ate`],
  [`bitsy`, `strolled`],
  [`strawberry`, `Slept`],
  [`Bitsy`, `  `],
]

const cleanSlothDiaryEntries =
  // Pass the entries through each operation in order, and then return the last
  // operation's result
  pipe(
    messySlothDiaryEntries,
    // Transform each entry by trimming and lowercasing strings
    map(([sloth, activity]) => [
      sloth.toLowerCase(),
      activity.trim().toLowerCase(),
    ]),
    // Remove each entry that has an empty activity
    filter(([, activity]) => activity.length > 0),
    // Collect the clean entries into an array
    reduce(toArray()),
  )

console.log(cleanSlothDiaryEntries)
//=> [
//=>   [ 'strawbery', 'slept' ],
//=>   [ 'max', 'ate' ],
//=>   [ 'strawbery', 'climbed' ],
//=>   [ 'bitsy', 'ate' ],
//=>   [ 'bitsy', 'strolled' ],
//=>   [ 'strawbery', 'slept' ]
//=> ]
```

### Async iterables

`lfi` also exports functions for processing async iterables. Here we show how
to:

1. Take an async iterable, in this case one that reads a file line by line
2. Group and map its elements asynchronously
3. Collect the elements into a promise that resolves to a data structure, in
   this case an array

```js playground
import {
  chunkAsync,
  flatMapAsync,
  mapAsync,
  pipe,
  reduceAsync,
  toArray,
} from 'lfi'

// The file has one sloth name per line
const FILENAME = `every-sloth-name.txt`
const API_URL = `https://random-word-form.herokuapp.com/random/adjective`

const slothSquadStatementsPromise = pipe(
  // Create an async iterable over the file lines, in this case sloth names
  (await fetch(new URL(`https://lfi.dev/${FILENAME}`))).body,
  flatMapAsync(chunk => new TextDecoder().decode(chunk).split(`\n`)),
  // Chunk the sloth names into array groups of 4, also known as a sloth squad
  chunkAsync(4),
  // Transform each sloth squad into a statement by asynchronously querying an
  // API for an adjective to describe the squad
  mapAsync(async slothSquad => {
    const [adjective] = await (await fetch(API_URL)).json()
    const leadingSloths = slothSquad.slice(0, 3)
    const trailingSloth = slothSquad.at(-1)
    return `${leadingSloths.join(`, `)}, and ${trailingSloth} are ${adjective}!`
  }),
  // Collect the statements into a promise that resolves to an array
  reduceAsync(toArray()),
)

console.log(await slothSquadStatementsPromise)
//=> [
//=>   'strawberry, max, bitsy, and tommy jolly!',
//=>   'penny, millie, coco, and polly are kindhearted!',
//=>   'betty, bubbles, pearl, and sid are stylish!',
//=>   'ava, brooke, lottie, and jeremiah are beloved!'
//=> ]
```

### Concurrent iterables

You may have noticed that the previous example queries the API sequentially.
Each sloth squad has to wait for the previous squad's query to finish before it
can make its own query.

Sloths may be slow, but that doesn't mean we have to be!

`lfi` also exports functions for its own custom
[concurrent iterable](/docs/concepts/concurrent-iterable) protocol. Here we show
how to:

1. Take an async iterable, in this case the one from the previous example
2. Convert it to a concurrent iterable, also known as a "concur iterable"
3. Map its elements concurrently
4. Collect the elements into a promise that resolves to a data structure, in
   this case an array, concurrently

```js playground
import {
  asConcur,
  chunkAsync,
  flatMapAsync,
  mapConcur,
  pipe,
  reduceConcur,
  toArray,
} from 'lfi'

// The file has one sloth name per line
const FILENAME = `every-sloth-name.txt`
const API_URL = `https://random-word-form.herokuapp.com/random/adjective`

const slothSquadStatementsPromise = pipe(
  // Create an async iterable over the file lines, in this case sloth names
  (await fetch(new URL(`https://lfi.dev/${FILENAME}`))).body,
  flatMapAsync(chunk => new TextDecoder().decode(chunk).split(`\n`)),
  // Chunk the sloth names into array groups of 4, also known as a sloth squad
  chunkAsync(4),
  // Convert the async iterable into a concur iterable. Every subsequent
  // operation will process the sloth squads concurrently without waiting on
  // other squads
  asConcur,
  // Transform each sloth squad into a statement by asynchronously querying an
  // API for an adjective to describe the squad, all concurrently with other
  // squads
  mapConcur(async slothSquad => {
    const [adjective] = await (await fetch(API_URL)).json()
    const leadingSloths = slothSquad.slice(0, 3)
    const trailingSloth = slothSquad.at(-1)
    return `${leadingSloths.join(`, `)}, and ${trailingSloth} are ${adjective}`
  }),
  // Collect the statements into a promise that resolves to an array. Note that
  // the concurrency means that the order of statements in the array may not
  // match the order of the sloths in the file
  reduceConcur(toArray()),
)

console.log(await slothSquadStatementsPromise)
// NOTE: This order may change between runs
//=> [
//=>   'strawberry, max, bitsy, and tommy jolly!',
//=>   'ava, brooke, lottie, and jeremiah are beloved!',
//=>   'betty, bubbles, pearl, and sid are stylish!',
//=>   'penny, millie, coco, and polly are kindhearted!'
//=> ]
```
